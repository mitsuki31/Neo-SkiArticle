        ⚠️ **Important:** Please report critical vulnerabilities privately.  
        If the issue could expose sensitive information, compromise builds, or critical issues, contact the maintainer directly via the method listed in [security.txt](https://neoski.vercel.app/.well-known/security.txt) instead of opening a public issue.

        For all other issues, use this form to report the problem responsibly.  
        See the full [Security Policy](https://neoski.vercel.app/security) for more details.
