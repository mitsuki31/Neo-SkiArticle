**Neo-SkiArticle**

_Last updated: November 15, 2025_

## Summary

**Neo-SkiArticle** is a public, static website for the school community. This site does **not** collect or store personal data from visitors. We use a small set of third-party analytics and monitoring tools to understand site health and usage; those tools collect aggregated, non-identifying metrics only.

## What We Collect

For operational and monitoring purposes we use **Vercel Analytics** and similar infrastructure insights. These services collect limited, usage-oriented data such as:

- Page views and timestamps
- Referrer and path information (which pages were visited)
- Performance and error metrics (page load, status codes)
- Device and browser metadata (user agent, approximate geographic region)

We do **not** collect user-submitted personal data, account information, or store form submissions on this site.

## Cookies and Client Storage

This website does not set any tracking cookies for analytics beyond what Vercel or other platform defaults may use to provide aggregated analytics. No third-party advertising or cross-site trackers are used.

## Third-party Services

We rely on Vercel (hosting and analytics). Please note:
- Third-party services have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing Vercel’s documentation and privacy notice for details about their data handling. [Learn **Vercel’s Privacy Policy**](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)
- We do not share school-managed private data with third parties via this public site.

## Data Retention

Analytics data is retained by the third-party provider according to their retention policies. We **do not** retain any personal data from visitors on this site.

## Community of Schools

The site is intended for the school community. If you are a parent or guardian and believe there is private or identifying information on the site that should be removed, contact us using the method in `/.well-known/security.txt`.
